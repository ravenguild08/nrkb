a Nurikabe UI and solver using python and wxPython
- 6 different size board libraries courtesy of www.puzzle-nurikabe.com
- instantaneous click and drag interaction
- high score recording capability, but in a visible .json file
- intelligent red highlighting of errors
- a check() method that evaluates a passed board instead of comparing to a solution
- a solve() method that applies the inherent rules of nurikabe and
  repeatedly guesses for unknown portions.


nrkb.py               :: UI and controller for user interaction
nrkb_logic.py         :: game logic, solver, and checker
nrkb_fctrl.py         :: file interaction

[size]x[size].json    :: json-encoded board files for size in {5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 20}
scores.json           :: created file for saved high scores. no need to package
nrkb.ico/png/icns     :: icons for compiled .exe

nrkb_debug.py         :: starts a game and runs solve
count.py              :: prints how many boards of each size of board
nrkb_process.py       :: stores a board in load.txt as a json-encoded array
/nrkb/nrkb_spider.py  :: crawler that visits www.puzzle-nurikabe.com to scrape boards


version 1.2 :: 2013-8-29
- swapped out deep recursion for shallow guessing
- changed communication from solver to controller using a queue
- set explicit size for high scores
- changed debug to print out game index

version 1.1 :: 2013-8-29
- README finally created
- UI flagging behavior vastly improved to only highlight wrong regions
- check split into a version for the UI to call and a short-circuiter for the solver
- updating time when not supposed to corrected

version 1.0 :: 2013-3-28
- controller has locking mechanism cleaned up
- high scores able to be recorded, reset
- git version control begun
- UI timer behavior corrected

version 0.2 :: 2013-3-25
- first packaged into an exe
- nrkb.png/ico created
- controller starts a daemon thread to run solver so that it can be killed
- UI turns red on error, highlighting wrong groups
- boards turned into .json instead of .txt

version 0.1 :: 2013-3-23
- timer included in the UI
- checker mostly correct. many isolated bugs. used reachers design
- solver had most sophisticated functions like chaining and reaching
- solver turned into recursive guesser, making it successful on small boards but
  hopelessly slow on long boards
- a spider to crawl complete, although kind of hacky. must be run once to grab
  one board, and size needs to be manually changed in source

version 0.0 :: 2013-3-20
- a basic UI complete. click and drag cursor has correct behavior
- preferences dialog implemented to change sizes
- about, help, clear, new, quit events strung together
- file functionality able to read and write boards, but boards have to be typed in
- logic incomplete. groups kind of work, but bugs are everywhere
